## 📚 Main Content

### Research Paper
**[POSC 250 Research Paper 2.pdf](./POSC%20250%20Research%20paper%202.pdf)**
- Complete academic analysis of government technology implementation
- Data-driven insights into public sector digital transformation
- Comprehensive literature review and methodology

## 🔬 Research Methodology

This project collects and analyzes data on government technology implementation and performance metrics from various sources including:
- Government Open Data Portals
- Political Science Research Databases  
- Technology Implementation Surveys
- Public Policy Repositories
- Oxford Meta Study (heavily referenced)

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

All graphics and visualizations were created using **ManimGL**, a Python library for mathematical animations.
- **ManimGL Repository**: https://github.com/3b1b/manim
- All sourcing and data was either algorithmically collected or hand-selected from pre-existing databases

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `/gov_analysis/` - Data analysis scripts and datasets
- `/manimlib.py/` - Custom Manim implementations for visualizations
- Research paper and presentation files in root directory
